Metadata includes information about the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of geodata. It is necessary to document the temporal and spatial context of your data. The DAaaS Geospatial Platform utalizes the following standards: ISO 19115-2003 HNAP , GeoDCAT-ap, SDMX. Standards facilitate the creation, sharing, and general use of geospatial data. Standards are necessary for interoperability between platforms, especially in the cloud environment. 19115-2003 HNAP The North American Profile of ISO 19115 - Geographic information - Metadata (HNAP - Metadata), published by the Canadian General Standards Board, identifies the geospatial metadata needed for North America to describe geospatial data, including dataset and dataset series, and related Web services. This metadata format is a Canadian variant of the North America Profile of ISO 19115 2003, which has a defined XML schema that supports federal government requirements. However, HNAP is not fully compatible with either the ISO or the NAP standards and thus requires unique processing which has been inigrated in the DAaaS Platform.

A GIS (Geospatial Information System) helps us analyze spatial relationships and patterns amongst these phenomena.

DAaaS has been designed to help our users meet these neeeds. About Spatial Data Spatial data are data types (files, databases, web services) that encode geographic information for use in location-aware applications. There are two types: Vector data points (x, y, z coordinates) lines (roads, networks) polygons (areas). Raster data images or grids of digital values; eg. satellite imagery.
