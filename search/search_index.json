Metadata supports users in locating and accessing their own resources, and data consumers in locating and using geodata resources produced by others. Metadata includes compound data about the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of geodata. 19115-2003 HNAP The North American Profile of ISO 19115 - Geographic information - Metadata (NAP - Metadata), published by the Canadian General Standards Board, identifies the geospatial metadata that are needed for North America to describe geospatial data, including dataset and dataset series, and related Web services. This Profile provides a mechanism to support cultural and linguistic adaptability by enabling representation of free text in multiple languages and by introducing the NAP Metadata Register describing metadata in multiple languages. It outlines the characteristic properties of the data to be recorded, as well as the values each property should have, to ensure that metadata elements are encoded in a clear and consistent manner. Required Elements This section provides guidelines for populating minimum mandatory metadata elements for Government of Canada geospatial datasets. Element Description File Identifier Each metadata record shall have a universal unique identifier (UUID) to distinguish it from others.

It provides an RDF syntax binding for the union of all metadata elements defined in the core profile 19115. GeoDCAT is a vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between catalogs. It increases discoverability and will enable federalization of datasets. GeoDCAT does not replace 19115; its purpose is to enhance it for catalogs.
